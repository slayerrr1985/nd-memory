## Objective of the Game

The game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.

Game displays the current number of moves a user has made, a timer, and a star rating from 1 to 5:
 
 *  5 stars - 10 moves or less
 *  4 stars - more than 10 moves
 *  3 stars - more than 20 moves
 *  2 stars - more than 25 moves
 *  1 star  - more than 30 moves

A restart button allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating.

When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again and tells the user how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating was.
